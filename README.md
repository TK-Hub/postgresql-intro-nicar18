# postgresql-intro-nicar18
This repo includes data and sample queries for the PostgreSQL hands-on class at NICAR 2018 in Chicago. The material is drawn from the more advanced chapters of this author's book [Practical SQL](https://www.nostarch.com/practicalsql). You can find all the code examples and data for the book [here](https://github.com/anthonydb/practical-sql).

## Topics
* A few basic queries
* Stats functions
* Spatial queries with PostGIS
* Full-text search
* Creating functions

## Setup
If you're trying this at home, here's how to get rolling.

* Download this repo to your computer.
* To create tables and load data, you can execute the queries in the file [pg_create_import.sql](https://github.com/anthonydb/postgresql-intro-nicar18/blob/master/pg_create_import.sql) using pgAdmin, the psql command-line tool, or another GUI.
* You can then run the queries in [pg_demo_queries.sql](https://github.com/anthonydb/postgresql-intro-nicar18/blob/master/pg_demo_queries.sql)
